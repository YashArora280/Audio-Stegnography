# Audio-Stegnography
Developed a Python-based application that enables secure audio file encryption and decryption using Diffie-Hellman key exchange and AES encryption. The system derives a shared secret to generate a 256-bit AES key, ensuring end-to-end confidentiality of .wav files. Implemented public/private key generation, secure audio storage
